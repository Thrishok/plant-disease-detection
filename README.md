# plant-disease-detection
Plant disease detection using ResNet and CNN classifies plant leaf images to identify diseases. CNN extracts features, while ResNet's residual connections improve deep model training. Trained on labeled datasets, the model predicts diseases in new images with high accuracy, aiding early detection and improving crop health.
